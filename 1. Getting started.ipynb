    "# Introduction to python\n",
    "Python is a cross platform interpreted programming language, this means that the same code (with minor caveats) will work on windows and unix operating systems. The code is interpeted by a python interpreter that is installed onto your system, the interpeter converts the python code into operations that the machine can follow.   \n",
    "\n",
    "On some system python comes pre-installed (linux systems), however I would recommend using the Anaconda package manage to maange your python installation. This allows you to easily have different python environments for managing different versions of code and to avoid conflicts. It also means you can download python packages from anaconda channels where the package has been compiled with the correct dependencies for your system. This means you are less likely to have strange errors that are difficult to debug. \n",

    "I would recommend installing [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",

    "Navigating around the computer without the graphical file explorer can be challenging at first if dragging/dropping and clicking on things is what you're used to.\n",

    "The below examples list six common Windows and equivalent Unix commands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. dir/ls: Lists each file in the directory you are currently in.\n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",
    "2. Windows: Download and run the relevant installer making sure to check the 'Add to PATH option'.\n",

    "Programming is giving a computer instructions to perform. Python is an **interpreted** language which means every instruction is evaluated and executed in real-time, whereas **compiled** languages evaluate all the instructions ahead of time and create a binary file which then gets executed later. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new directory for this session using the command line and navigate into it.\n",
    "2. Type 'python' to run the conda python interpreter. Here is where we execute python instructions directly.\n",

    "Warning:\n",
    "This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### From File\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new file called 'temp.py'. The .py extension lets the computer and interpreter know what kind of file this is and how to run it.\n",
    "2. Write an instruction or two you tried in the interpreter ie \n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(3+4)\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Save this file and run it in the command line typing 'python temp.py', ie calling the interpreter and pointing at your instructions in file format. Is there any difference between these python execution methods?"
