# Getting started with Python
Python is a cross platform interpreted programming language, this means that the same code (with minor caveats) will work on windows and unix operating systems. The code is interpeted by a python interpreter that is installed onto your system, the interpeter converts the python code into operations that the machine can follow.

On some system python comes pre-installed (linux systems), however I would recommend using the Anaconda package manage to maange your python installation. This allows you to easily have different python environments for managing different versions of code and to avoid conflicts. It also means you can download python packages from anaconda channels where the package has been compiled with the correct dependencies for your system. This means you are less likely to have strange errors that are difficult to debug.

I would recommend installing [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

A useful guide in getting started in anaconda is here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html

## Requirements for this tutorial
* A working python environment (preferably anaconda)
* Jupyter notebook package `pip unstall jupyter` or `conda install jupyter`

To get started download and unzip this repository to your computer and open up an anaconda command prompt or terminal. 
Change directory to the location of the files `cd $WHERE YOU SAVED IT`. 
Now start a jupyter notebook server `jupyter notebook` and browse to `localhost:8888` on your computer.
